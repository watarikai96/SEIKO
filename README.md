**SEiKŌ – Read. Mine. Master.
| Contemporary Language Acquisition Structured System

SEiKŌ is a gamified kanji and vocabulary acquisition system built around real books and powered by intelligent, AI-assisted immersion. Designed for learners of Japanese (and later Chinese), SEiKŌ transforms reading into mastery — one sentence, one kanji, one insight at a time.

SEiKŌ

SEiKŌ empowers users to reach native-level literacy through deep interaction with native texts — EPUB novels, light novels, and manhua — while unlocking structured, intelligent learning paths along the way.

Key Features:
    •    Immersive EPUB Reader – Tap-to-parse native sentences, view furigana, pitch, and tokenized breakdowns.
    •    Auto Mining Engine – Instantly extract vocab, kanji, and grammar from every sentence you read.
    •    FSRS Review System – Spaced repetition review that adjusts to your learning retention curve.
    •    Gamified Progression – Master 100,000 words, all Kanken kanji, and grammar points with XP, streaks, badges, and visual maps.
    •    Kanji Mastery Grid – Track your conquest of all 6500+ Kanken kanji across levels 10級 to 1級.
    •    Book Intelligence Dashboard – See how many words, kanji, and grammar points you mined per book — and how much you’ve conquered.
    •    GPT-Powered Tutor – Ask “Why is this grammar used?”, generate cloze cards, or get native-like rewrites on any sentence.
    •    Shadowing + Pronunciation Practice – Built-in speech evaluation and repeat-after-me drills powered by Whisper.

AI Assisted Features (Coming Soon)

We’re building intelligent systems to enhance your reading immersion and maximize retention:
    •    Sentence Difficulty Scorer – Let SEiKŌ auto-highlight which parts you’re ready for (or not).
    •    Adaptive Reading Assistant – GPT auto-simplifies or annotates complex text.
    •    Smart Vocabulary Recommendations – Learn what’s statistically most relevant based on your reading history.
    •    Grammar Unlock Engine – Unlock real JLPT/HSK grammar by seeing it used, not memorizing it.
    •    Sentence Rephraser – View native-level paraphrases of what you’re reading.

These features are under active development and will be rolled out in future releases of SEiKŌ.

    •    Stores dictionary, grammar, and book analytics in pre-processed SQLite/JSON formats
    •    Uses GPT API and Whisper ASR for smart feedback and interactions
    •    Includes custom tokenizer pipelines (SudachiPy, Jieba) and EPWING-converted dictionaries for lightning-fast lookups
